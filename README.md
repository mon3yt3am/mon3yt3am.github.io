## todo:
- [ ] change about us divs to be clickable to open a draggable, resizable, closable bio window
- [ ] add FAQ w/ "Have more questions or want to email us directly?" button that drops down email form
- [ ] add light mode switch

spencer suggestions :
 - maybe add more contrast between foreground and background?
 - slightly larger text all around? at least 10 pts higher font
 - larger services box overall by about 25%
 - remove or hide the white scrollbars on the top half of the homepage
